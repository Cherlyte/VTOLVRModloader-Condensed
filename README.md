# VTOLVR Modloader Condensed
The VTOL VR Modloader, Condensed. As in the act of condensing steam back into water, thus removing it from the loop.

This is a fork of the VTOL VR Modloader found at https://gitlab.com/vtolvr-mods/ModLoader without any Steam implementations present, thus reducing bloat and killing the annoying SteamQueries application that runs in the background at all times. 
It also includes a few QoL things i found nice, such as the Play button in the manager starting VTOLVR through its executable, and a new "Enable by Default" option that loads the modloader with the game without the need for special launch arguments or the manager.
